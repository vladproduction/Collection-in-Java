Practice: working with objects in collections,
converting text from file into collection object and operations with it;

*model: Box, HeavyBox extends Box implements Comparable<HeavyBox>;

*test:
1)TestCollections:
-(tests 1-7): List, lambda, stream, forEach, Iterator, Comparator, etc. (Box, HeavyBox);
-(tests 8-13): BufferedReader, List<String>, Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(),
               Set<String> set = new TreeSet<>(strings), etc. (working with text file)

2)Exercises:
-(tests): BufferedReader, List, Map, lambda, stream, etc.  (working with text file);
