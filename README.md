# Collection-in-Java
List, Set, Queue; Map

The collection in java is the root interface of the collection framework and provide several classes and interfaces to represent a group of individual objects as a single unit. List, Set, and Queue are the main child interfaces of the collection interface.
Map is stands here, but it is not collection. We can say - container.
A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value.
